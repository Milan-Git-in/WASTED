saving data in supabase


create a supabase client or borrow it from supabase.py since it has premade client

once the client is created, we have two options 


1. create a model and store in using that model 
2. just use supabase.table("tablename").insert()


option one will work everytime however option two will fail if the data table isnt already
created

however, id want u to use option 2 and tell me what table u want me to create since it reduces 
work overhead for u.



in option one, you will need to make migration and then run the supabase.table insert function
